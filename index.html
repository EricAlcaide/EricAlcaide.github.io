<br/>Be water, my friend.
<br/>
<br/>Donâ€™t get set into one form
<br/>adapt it and build your own, 
<br/>and let it grow,
<br/>be like water.
<br/>
<br/>Empty your mind, 
<br/>be formless,
<br/>shapeless -
<br/>like water. 
<br/>
<br/>Now you put water in a cup,
<br/>it becomes the cup;
<br/>You put water into a bottle,
<br/>it becomes the bottle;
<br/>You put it in a teapot,
<br/>it becomes the teapot.
<br/>
<br/>Now water can flow
<br/>or it can crash. 
<br/>Be water, my friend. 
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>Roses are red, violets are blue.
<br/>Being original, that's what I do.
